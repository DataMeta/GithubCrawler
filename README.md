# GitHub crawler
This program enables one to search for GitHub users using various criteria and then crawls through the user(s)' repositories, parsing the source code for all variables.

Can be modified to download source code of any language(s), as well as any accompanying documents.

Should passively defend against rate-limiting in a respectful manner.
