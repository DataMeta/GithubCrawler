# GithubSourceAnalyzer
This program enables one to search for GitHub users using various criteria and then crawls through the user(s)' repositories, parsing the source code for all variables. It then displays statistics on the data gathered which can be leveraged to compare and contrast the characteristic signatures of code writing between various "levels" or types of programmers. This is a case study in programming practices. I seek to find what patterns novices display and what patterns are found throughout the work of highly experienced developers. The next goal is to accrue meaningful data on the structure of users' methods and classes.
